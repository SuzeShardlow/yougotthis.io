Claire Knight is a remote (yep, even pre-COVID) Senior Software Engineering Manager who has worked in many areas of technology over the years. She has served plenty of time in the coal code mine before making the move into also wrangling folks rather than just bits. She is currently working at GitHub where she helps devs all over the world do their best work. Claire lives in Berkshire, UK, with her husband Steve and three cats who from time to time also like to be involved in video calls. When not working, she likes to lift heavy things, only to put them down again.
