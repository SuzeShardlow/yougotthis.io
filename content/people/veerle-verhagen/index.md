Veerle Verhagen is a software tester with RisQIT. After getting a degree in Latin and Italian from the University of Glasgow, she taught English in Turin, Italy for a couple of years. Being someone who likes to do the unexpected, after that brief career in education she went and got a Masters’ in Indo-European Linguistics and then promptly turned around and switched to IT. She immediately felt at home in the software testing community, where almost everyone is even weirder than she is. When she’s not at the office, you might find Veerle outside exploring hiking trails, in the kitchen testing stew recipes, or at metal festivals applying her social skills.
