Steven Hicks is a Senior Engineer at Artsy. He loves JavaScript and specializes as a generalist. Steve believes that code is written for humans, and that if you ain't falling, you ain't learning. When he isn't talking to the duck or smooshing 1s and 0s, you can find Steve outside -- probably camping with his family, running trails, or riding his bike.
