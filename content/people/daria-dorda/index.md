I am a trainer, in my professional career, I passionately share my knowledge. As a leader, a psychologist, a trainer and coach, I have built and implemented several leadership and talent programs from scratch. With these qualifications and experiences, I dare to say: Nothing good comes from an unprepared leader; neither for the teams nor for the leader.  I teach people and organizations.

I love to work with leaders, specialists and whole teams to help them grow. People, their behaviors and dynamics keep fascinating me every day. I value my client’s goals and potential while respecting their readiness to change. Change is the most courageous thing one can undertake.  I am a healthy workplace enthusiast.

I believe that “soft skills” aren’t really that soft and are probably ‘harder’ to learn if taken seriously. They are precious skills that don’t allow themselves to be estimated or invoiced, but they will largely decide whether your project & organisation will be successful or not. Together, we have the power to change our organizations and the way we connect with others.
