## Tees, Sweatshirts, and Jigsaws

If your order meets our returns policies, you may cancel or return your products at any time up until the later of 14 days after you receive the products or 28 days after we dispatch them for delivery to you. If you're in the UK we provide a Freepost returns address. For EU/International orders you'll need to pay to post the items back to us.

However, unless they are defective, we cannot accept returns of custom products or any products that have been washed or worn.

Our fulfillment of these items is through our partner Teemill. For more information about returning items check out our [Teemill Store FAQ](https://yougotthisconf.teemill.com/help/).

## Stickers

If you receive and do not like your stickers, you can return them within 14 days for a full refund. You must send all stickers in a pack, unused, to us. If you're in the UK we will cover postage, otherwise you will need to pay for the return of the items.
