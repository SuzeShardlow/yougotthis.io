title: Sponsor You Got This!
---

You Got This! is a learning hub focused on core skills needed for a happy and healthy work life. We offer a free content library and a number of community events.

It is incredibly important to us that speakers and writers are paid for their time, and that all events are accessible, and that increases our running costs. That's where you come in!

## Sponsorship Opportunities

### Sponsor Seasonal Meetups

Our seasonal events are quarterly online meetups which typically have 150-200 attendees and have 7 10-minute talks with questions. We take up to 4 sponsors per event.

Meetup sponsorship is £500 per event or £1750 for 4 if paid upfront. It includes:
- Your logo on event webpage, on the livestream, and library pages.
- A 5 minute live or pre-recorded talk to be shared as part of the livestream.
- 3 Tweets of thanks.

_Note: all 2022 seasonal meetup slots are sold._

### Sponsor Annual Special Meetup

Our annual 'special' online meetup focuses on a single theme throughout. It expects 200 attendees and will have 5 15-minute talks with questions. We take up to 4 sponsors per event.

2022's special event is [Navigating Nightmares](/events/navigating-nightmares) on October 31.

Meetup sponsorship is £500. It includes:
- Your logo on event webpage, on the livestream, and library pages.
- A 5 minute live or pre-recorded talk to be shared as part of the livestream.
- 3 Tweets of thanks.

### Sponsor Annual Conference

Our annual January conference is our flagship event. All content is made available for free after the event.

The next conference is Jan 14-15 2023. We expect 1500-1700 attendees. [Get in touch](mailto:kevin@yougotthis.io) to find out more.

### Sponsor Articles

You Got This has historically only provided video content in the talk library. From Q3 2022 we will be releasing written content - starting at a cadence of one post every two weeks. All articles will be related to core skills.

Each 3 month period will be sold as a single sponsorship block. As we don't yet know what our viewership will look like, we are significantly discounting sponsorship for the first two quarters.

Article sponsorship is £2500 per quarter. It includes:
- Customized call-to-actions will be present at the top, middle, and end of each post you sponsor. Get in touch if you want more information about this.
- 3 Tweets of thanks.
## Inclusion

We'll keep this brief. It's important that as many people as possible have access to our initiatives. To aid that, we:

- Pay all speakers and authors.
- Have a live captioner at all events.
- Publish videos swiftly with transcripts and closed captions.
- Have an inclusion programme whenever we have paid activities which awards free tickets to those who would be otherwise unable to attend.
- Enforce a Code of Conduct in all community spaces we operate.

## Audience

For the first time since You Got This was formed, we asked monitoring questions as part of registration to our conference in January 2022. This allows us to best understand our audience. This is what we learned:

- 35.6% of our audience as self-taught developers.
- 72.9% of our audience use she/her, they/them, or multiple pronouns.
- 28.7% of our audience are early-career. 30.7% of our audience are seniors or managers+.
- 47% of the audience that attend You Got This events are considering a change in jobs.
- Our audience primarily spans the UK, USA, Ireland, Spain, and Germany.

## Surplus Funds

Surplus funds go towards ongoing running costs of You Got This! Any further additional funds are put towards the next inclusion programme we run (generally providing free tickets to our paid workshops before conferences).

## Interested?

Great! Pop an email to [kevin@yougotthis.io](mailto:kevin@yougotthis.io) with the initiatives you are interested in sponsoring. We look forward to having you involved.
