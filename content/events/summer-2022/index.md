    title="The Subtle Art of Asking for Things"
    start="2022-03-09T18:55:00Z"
    :speakers="['kurt-kemple']"
    description="Over the course of my career I've spent a lot of time either asking for things or being asked for things. After countless collaborations and asks, I've come to understand the nature of relationships and what makes a good ask. As it turns out it's a bit more involved than sliding into someone's DMs with 'hey.' In this talk you'll learn how to get better results from your asks by rethinking the nature of relationships and following the three Rs of asking for things: Recognition, Request, and Reward.">

    title="Recognizing and Overcoming Self-Sabotage"
    start="2022-03-09T19:30:00Z"
    :speakers="['arit-developer']"
    description="Whenever we embark on a new venture or pursuit, we immediately become embroiled in a contest between our current and our aspirational selves. Our vision & potential face off against our habits, comfort zones & rationalizations, resulting in patterns which limit growth, frustrations and several start-stop-maybe-start-again cycles. In this talk, we'll uncover ways to efficiently recognize self-sabotage, and strategies to consistently overcome it.">
