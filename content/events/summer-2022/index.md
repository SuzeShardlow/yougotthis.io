    description="Over the course of my career I've spent a lot of time either asking for things or being asked for things. After countless collaborations and asks, I've come to understand the nature of relationships and what makes a good ask. As it turns out it's a bit more involved than sliding into someone's DMs with 'hey.' In this talk you'll learn how to get better results from your asks by rethinking the nature of relationships and following the three Rs of asking for things: Recognition, Request, and Reward.">
