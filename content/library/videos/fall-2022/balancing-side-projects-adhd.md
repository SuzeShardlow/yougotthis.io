  short: Luke shares their experience in identifying, managing, and manipulating their ADHD traits.
  full: ADHD, ADD and similar neuro-behavioural disorders are often seen as the kryptonite of folks completing things. The stereotype for years was the naughty kid at school who could never concentrate, would never finish anything and constantly disrupts everyone else. Thereâ€™s a balance though, because while some ADHD traits make getting anything done almost impossible, others can be harnessed as superpowers to get shit done. Luke is going to share their experiences of attempting to identify, manage and manipulate these traits, and how this has manifested in successful (and many unsuccessful) side projects through the years. This talk is for folks who have ADHD, suspect they might have ADHD, or are just interested in how different people think and achieve the things they do.
