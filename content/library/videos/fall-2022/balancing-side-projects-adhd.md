    ADHD, ADD and similar neuro-behavioural disorders are often seen as the
    kryptonite of folks completing things. The stereotype for years was the
    naughty kid at school who could never concentrate, would never finish
    anything and constantly disrupts everyone else. Thereâ€™s a balance though,
    because while some ADHD traits make getting anything done almost impossible,
    others can be harnessed as superpowers to get shit done. Luke is going to
    share their experiences of attempting to identify, manage and manipulate
    these traits, and how this has manifested in successful (and many
    unsuccessful) side projects through the years. This talk is for folks who
    have ADHD, suspect they might have ADHD, or are just interested in how
    different people think and achieve the things they do.
