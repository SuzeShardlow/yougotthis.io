    Setting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a common and important part of
    leading your team - making sure everyone knows what you're working towards.
    But they can be tricky to get right, and even harder to help others
    understand. If you're a leader that's ever searched for 'What do OKRs look
    like?', this talk's for you! We'll start with what OKRs are, how they're
    measured, and how they should cascade through a business to make sure
    everyone is on the same page. We'll also cover how to use OKRs to work on
    what you actually want, not just what others want you to do.
