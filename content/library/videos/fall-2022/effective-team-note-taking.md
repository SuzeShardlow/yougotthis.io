  short: Discussing strategies for taking and finding notes as a team.
  full: As your teams grow, so does your collective knowledge of all that you've built together. Managing and documenting that knowledge can be daunting, but it's so important for remembering decisions, creating new ideas without reinventing the wheel, and bringing new teammates up to speed.
