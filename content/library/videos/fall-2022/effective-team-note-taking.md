  full: >-
    As your teams grow, so does your collective knowledge of all that you've
    built together. Managing and documenting that knowledge can be daunting, but
    it's so important for remembering decisions, creating new ideas without
    reinventing the wheel, and bringing new teammates up to speed. In this talk,
    we'll discuss strategies for taking (and finding!) notes as a team.
