# Contributing Guidelines

We love that you're here and wanting to contribute to the You Got This! project. To participate, you must abide by the [You Got This! Code of Conduct](https://yougotthis.io/conduct). 

## Types of Contribution

### Content: Articles & Videos

Please do not contribute articles or videos to this repo. We have months of content mapped out, and have strict requirements on what is accepted. If you want to add new content, please [email us](mailto:kevin@yougotthis.io).

### Content: Transcripts

Each video is accompanied by a transcript, either created by a person live at the event, or by software. In both cases, there are likely to be errors. Common errors include:

1. Misspellings of names or technical jargon.
2. Incorrect paragraph breaks.
3. Missing words (often denoted by `...`).

Currently, transcripts are inconsistent, but we favor American English and use of the Oxford Comma. 

### Content: Summaries

Transcripts are generally intelligent verbatim transcripts (with every word shown, except fillers like "you know", "um", and "so"). In written form, they are far from concise. 

Summaries are a new effort to extract key learnings from video transcripts. We welcome these contributions - an example is available in [/content/library/videos/fall-2022/wtf-are-okrs.md](../content/library/videos/fall-2022/wtf-are-okrs.md)

### Content: Collections

Collections are groups of content. They are grouped either around the event they are delivered at or around a specific learning goal or theme. 

We welcome suggestions for new collections of content. 

### Platform: Bug Fixes

If you find a bug, please first report it using GitHub Issues. Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labeled `bug`.

If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, send a Pull Request from your own fork and mention the Issue number.

### Platform: Improvements

If you'd like to accomplish something in the extension that it doesn't already do, describe the problem in a new GitHub Issue. Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labeled `enhancement`.

If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending too much time writing the code. In some cases, enhancements may not align well with the project objectives at the time.

### Developer: Documentation

The documentation for this project is fairly minimal as it has, for most of it's life, been a one-maintainer project. We welcome docs contributions to help others get involved!
